#README Smart-Switch--II/Blynk-Websocket #HELP #DOCUMENTATION
Features : 
This piece of code is an implementation of Blynk running on ESP8266 based modules (tested on nodemcu/ESP12E/F). 

It also implements websockets for various other tasks like running webs server and other simultaneous operation. 

It also uses Blynk inject feature so that the keys can be provided dynamically all you need to do is to go to local page 192.168.4.1 or the respective mdns name you have in your sketch while burning. 
This makes it a ready to go code where you do not need to do anything unless you are a tinkerer and wants to get more out of my crappy code. Kudos to you if you are contributing to improve this. Just note that this project is covered under open source GNU License and and as is disclaimer.
